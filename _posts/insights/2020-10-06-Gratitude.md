title: An attitude of gratitude - Improve your happiness by keeping a gratitude diary for a year
type: insights
---
We live in a golden age. Compared to our ancestors, we are healthier, wage fewer wars, are more efficient as a species, have more possessions, and are more connected to each other (physically and technologically, at least). We are objectively better off than any generation before us. And yet we take things for granted. We still suffer. On average, we are unhappier than our ancestors [1]. What can each of us - on an individual level - do about this?

There is a lot of good reading out there on how to be a happier person. There's also a lot of misleading reading out there. What I've done isn't necessarily the perfect path for everyone. However, it comes from a good place: from a combination of theory taught in UCT's Graduate School of Business' Advanced Leadership course, and Yale's course on The Science of Well-being [2]. Leadership, you ask? Well yes - you can't lead others effectively without being well centred yourself, hence happy with your life. The common thread taught by both these courses is that 40% of happiness is under our control, control which we can gain by training our thoughts over time: through gratitude, savouring, and mindfulness [3]. Unfortunately, 50% of happiness is genetic. The remaining 10% - just 10%! - is due to our actual circumstances in life.

Gratitude leads to happiness. And gratitude is trainable.
-------
When it comes to training happiness, the main trainable traits we have are gratitude, the ability to savour experiences, and mindfulness. So developing an attitude of gratitude is critical.  The good news: You can literally train yourself to be more grateful in life, through a daily habit of writing down things you are grateful for. You will find, as time goes by, you go from searching for things to be grateful for when writing your daily report, to very regularly noticing things you are grateful for. Then you take it further, learning through mindfulness how to truly savour these things, and exposing yourself to things and thoughts that make you grateful as often as possible.

Over the past year, I kept a gratitude diary. In order to show you what you can reasonably learn from this process, this article starts with an analysis of my gratitude diary, kept over the course of this year. It's quite tailored to my personal experience of this world, but hopefully it convinces you to do the same for yourself. I'll cover what I learnt about myself, and what I learnt about the process. At the end, you will find advice on undergoing this whole journey yourself, with links to relevant articles and a handy app to track your gratitude.

A year of gratitude 
--------
Just over a year ago, I made the decision to make a daily habit of tracking things I was grateful for. I can't remember exactly what spurred the decision, but I believe I was a bit disappointed in myself for recently having moved to an amazing city, Amsterdam, and yet seemed to take this whole lovely city and general improvement in the quality of my life for granted. I decided to buy a notebook which promptly lived a comfortable life on my bed stand. Every night before bed, I would write down three things which I was grateful for that day.

Over the year, during the good times, when I experienced something to be grateful for, I actually saved a note on my phone. which was great! I was learning to prompt myself right away that I had experienced something to be grateful for. Secondly, during the bad times, when I needed to really remind myself to think about what made me grateful, I installed Android's [Gratitude app]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northstar.gratitude&hl=en&gl=US) on my phone to remind me every evening to do this (and to digitize the process), in case I had forgotten through the day, and ignored the ever-present notebook. There were bad times indeed. Towards the end of winter came covid-19 lockdown and seasonal depression. At this point, I had maybe just a few entries per week. However, along with summer and a relaxed lockdown came a lot more gratitude.

At the end of the year, I exported data from the Gratitude app in .csv format, and added to it all my manual diary entries from the months before I had the app installed. Unfortunately, the app doesn't give you the ability to categorise your gratitude entries, so I had to manually categorise each. Fortunately, this was an _extremely_ rewarding process. Spending a drizzly Saturday morning going through hundreds of things that I was grateful for, and finding patterns in it, made me very happy with my life. A second wave of happiness!

So what did I find? By categorizing each gratitude entry, I found 35 categories of things I was grateful for over the year:

As you can see, I was particularly grateful for my living situation in Amsterdam and the Netherlands. As someone who had emigrated from overseas just a year prior, this makes sense. Happiness and gratitude is a relative thing [2]. Having lived in a country in relative turmoil, I was now extremely grateful to be in a country where everything... just worked. 

Secondly, also probably somewhat due to relative circumstances, I was very grateful for the  improvements in my social life. Of course, moving to a new city had resulted in some loneliness in the first year. It's not easy to make new friends in your 30s. However, after a lot of effort, things were clearly looking up.

Then came a long list of other things I was grateful for. This proved a challenge to really find any strong patterns, so I simplified things a bit by further categorising things:

![Gratitude](../images/insights/gratitude/categories.png "Gratitude")

Here, I could start to see a useful pattern. My gratitude, and therefore my happiness, was very heavily influenced by people, romance, and living in a wonderful place. Conversely, basic needs were underrepresented - this makes sense, as I have led a privileged life where my basic needs have almost always been met.

Very surprisingly, Accomplishment was very low, and "Possessions and financial security" quite low too. Both of these had many sub-categories, so their presence low in the chart indicated a big learning point for me, and hopefully for you, too: We spend a large portion of our life chasing accomplishment and possessions: 8-12 hours a day working or commuting to work, an hour or two a day exercising. Yet, these aren't the things that make me (or us [2]) feel grateful! Logically, we should be maximising time spent with people we value, and enjoying surroundings and experiences that we cherish. To a point - of course we also still need to put food on the table. Yet, in my case, I spend maybe one or two hours per day on experiencing any of the top 6 gratitude categories. Ouch.

Finally, it would be useful to look for any temporal patterns: I wanted to see if there was a pattern over the year for any particular type of gratitude. Only one: "Surroundings and city" takes off heavily in summer. Of course it did. Dutch summers are great.

There were many patterns reflected across the board, but these are largely due to my efforts to keep the project going. Firstly, there is the obvious jump of all gratitude in January due to a resolute attempt to be more grateful for my life. Thereafter, I really struggled to maintain this habit during the latter winter and spring months. With everything else happening (Seasonal depression, covid-19, heartbreak...), it was hard to keep this project up, despite having the diary next to my bed all year. However, things started picking up again in Summer due to a strong resolution to revisit this project, and of course due to the summer! Finally in September, some time away which provided a much needed boost to my mood and positive thoughts, even further accelerating the amount of grateful entries into the diary.

So what can you learn from a year of intentional gratitude?
-------
Firstly, and most importantly for mental well-being, a year of gratitude makes a MASSIVE difference to your thoughts. Multiple times per day, now, I stop and think 'Wow, that was awesome! I'm so grateful!' where I previously would've just taken it in my stride or ignored it. Without a doubt, I've successfully trained myself to be a much more grateful person.

Secondly, and unexpectedly, this can be a very useful input for decision making in future. I now have a very solid summary of what made me happy over the past year, and every time I am faced with a difficult decision (buy that car, or go on a holiday with my friends?), it becomes easier to understand what I will appreciate most, objectively. This is important, because as human beings, our intuition about what will make us happy (career success, a romantic partner, a fancy car) is completely off [2]. So why rely on intuition? Be a nerd and explore your data. This year of gratitude sums this up wonderfully.

Start your gratitude journey
---------
If you feel you could benefit from being more grateful about what you have, it's not difficult to do. It takes just 5 minutes a day.

* Get going on your gratitude diary. Now. Download the Gratitude app on [Android]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northstar.gratitude&hl=en&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gratitude-happiness-journal/id1372575227). Schedule an alert each evening before you go to bed to write down what made you grateful that day.
* At any point when you're down, look back and reflect at what made you happy. It's a rewarding process in itself.
* Take some time to notice how your thoughts of gratitude are coming more naturally. Also, notice when they aren't! That's a sure sign that you are going through a difficult time and should take more care of yourself.
* After a longer period of time, say a year, export your .csv file and categorise your data. Look back and figure yourself out. Spend a whole day on it, doing something along the lines of this analysis on your own entries. You may surprise yourself! But most importantly, you'll realise you've become a better, happier person.
* And even more importantly, enjoy the process! Remember, it's not a project so much as it's about savouring life and everything to be grateful about.
