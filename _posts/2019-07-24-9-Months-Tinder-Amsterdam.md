title: 9 Months of Tinder in Amsterdam
---

I have seen a lot of visualisations (generally [Sankeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram)) of people's 'success' on Tinder. The general reaction to these has been shock at the amount of swiping one does to get a match. Or discontent with the gender dynamics at play. So I requested my data [from Tinder](https://account.gotinder.com/data). I trudged through it, interested by what Tinder provides, what they don't, and what constructive lessons I may learn from my own data. 

But then the magnitude of the human experience I was seeing in this tiny data file hit me. 

Every swipe here was a real person. We've made online dating ridiculously efficient. But is this a good thing?

\* **Methodology footnotes:**
* My definition of a "relationship" is simply 3 or more dates. 
* The method is obviously not 100% accurate. It does not account for bots, those who are inactive who would have liked me back, those who I swiped left or right on more than once as they recreated their accounts, or dates I went on outside of the Tinder ecosystem.
