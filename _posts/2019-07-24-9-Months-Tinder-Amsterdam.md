title: 9 Months of Tinder in Amsterdam
---

Source: Tinder data request

Tools: Python, [pywaffle](https://github.com/ligyxy/PyWaffle), GIMP

I have seen a lot of visualisations (generally [Sankeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram)) of people's tinder experiences. The general reaction to these has been shock at the amount of swiping one does to get a match. So I requested my data [from Tinder](https://account.gotinder.com/data). I trudged through it, interested by what Tinder provides, what they don't, and what constructive lessons I may learn from my own data. 

But then the magnitude of the human experience I was seeing in this tiny data file hit me. 

Every swipe here was a real person. We've made online dating ridiculously efficient. But is it a good thing?
